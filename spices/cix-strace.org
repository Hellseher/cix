The strace program  intercepts and records the system calls  called and received
by  a running  process.  Strace  can print  a record  of each  system call,  its
arguments and  its return value.  Strace  is useful for diagnosing  problems and
debugging, as well as for instructional purposes.

Install strace if you need a tool to track the system calls made and received by
a process.
