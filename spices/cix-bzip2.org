=bzip2= is a freely available, patent-free, high quality data compressor. Bzip2
compresses files to within 10 to 15 percent of the capabilities of the best
techniques available. However, =bzip2= has the added benefit of being
approximately two times faster at compression and six times faster at
decompression than those techniques. =bzip2= is not the fastest compression
utility, but it does strike a balance between speed and compression capability.
