=nmap= is a utility for network exploration or security auditing. It supports
ping scanning (determine which hosts are up), many port scanning techniques
(determine what services the hosts are offering), and TCP/IP fingerprinting
(remote host operating system identification). =nmap= also offers flexible
target and port specification, decoy scanning, determination of TCP sequence
predictability characteristics, reverse-identd scanning, and more. In addition
to the classic command-line nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes a flexible
data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (netcat utility =ncat)=, a
utility for comparing scan results (=ndiff=), and a packet generation and
response analysis tool (=nping=).
