=tcsh= is an enhanced, but completely compatible version of the Berkeley UNIX C
shell (csh). It is a command language interpreter usable both as an interactive
login shell and a shell script command processor. It includes a command-line
editor, programmable word completion, spelling correction, a history mechanism,
job control and a C-like syntax.
