The RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a powerful command line driven package
management system capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying, querying, and
updating computer software packages. Each software package consists of an
archive of files along with information about the package like its version, a
description, and the like. There is also a library API, permitting advanced
developers to manage such transactions from programming languages such as C or
Python.
