The =nc= (or =netcat=) utility is used for just about anything under the sun
involving TCP, UDP, or UNIX-domain sockets. It can open TCP connections, send
UDP packets, listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports, do port scanning, and deal
with both IPv4 and IPv6. Unlike telnet(1), =nc= scripts nicely, and separates
error messages onto standard error instead of sending them to standard output,
as telnet(1) does with some.

*** nc::examples
**** nc-170109001313
setting up a one-shot webserver on port 8080 to present the content of a file:
:    ~$ { echo -ne "HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: $(wc -c < input_f)\r\n\r\n" cat input_f; } | nc -l -p8080

**** nc-170117213449
"share" a FILE on a localhost:PORT (FILE=file.txt PORT=80):
:    ~# while (nc -l 80 < file.txt > :); do : ;done

**** nc- 170824224751 
opening a raw connection to port 25 (like SMTP):
:    ~$ nc mail.server.net 25

**** nc-170924214013
connect TCP port 80 on host example.com:
:    ~$ nc -v example.com 80

**** nc-170924215315
keep listen for inbound connections on TCP port 1234:
:    ~$ nc -vv -l 1234

**** nc-170927230540
transfare file/dirrectory from one machine to other, both need nc avaialable:
:    ~# nc -l 7000 | tar -xzvpf -      # reciver
:    ~# tar -czf - * | nc reciver 7000 # transmiter
