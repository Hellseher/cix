GNU Parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one or more
computers. A job can be a single command or a small script that has to be run
for each of the lines in the input. The typical input is a list of files, a list
of hosts, a list of users, a list of URLs, or a list of tables. A job can also
be a command that reads from a pipe. GNU Parallel can then split the input and
pipe it into commands in parallel.
