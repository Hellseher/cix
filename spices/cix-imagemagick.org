ImageMagick includes a number of command-line utilities for manipulating images.
Most of you are probably accustomed to editing images one at a time with a
graphical user interface (GUI) with such programs as Gimp or Photoshop. However,
a GUI is not always convenient. Suppose you want to process an image dynamically
from a web script or you want to apply the same operations to many images or
repeat a specific operation at different times to the same or different image.
For these types of operations, the command-line image processing utility is
appropriate.
