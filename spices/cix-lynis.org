Lynis is an auditing and hardening tool for Unix/Linux and you might even call
it a compliance tool. It scans the system and installed software. Then it
performs many individual security control checks. It determines the hardening
state of the machine, detects security issues and provides suggestions to
improve the security defense of the system.
