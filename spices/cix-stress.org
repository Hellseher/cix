=stress= is not a benchmark, but is rather a tool designed to put given
subsytems under a specified load. Instances in which this is useful include
those in which a system administrator wishes to perform tuning activities, a
kernel or libc programmer wishes to evaluate denial of service possibilities,
etc.
