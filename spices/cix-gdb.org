** CVE
-	 CVE-2017-9778 :: GNU Debugger (GDB) 8.0 and earlier fails to detect a
                    negative length field in a DWARF section. A malformed
                    section in an ELF binary or a core file can cause GDB to
                    repeatedly allocate memory until a process limit is reached.
                    This can, for example, impede efforts to analyze malware
                    with GDB.
-	 CVE-2011-4355 :: GNU Project Debugger (GDB) before 7.5, when
                    .debug_gdb_scripts is defined, automatically loads certain
                    files from the current working directory, which allows local
                    users to gain privileges via crafted files such as Python
                    scripts.
-	 CVE-2006-4146 :: 	Buffer overflow in the (1) DWARF (dwarfread.c) and (2)
                    DWARF2 (dwarf2read.c) debugging code in GNU Debugger (GDB)
                    6.5 allows user-assisted attackers, or restricted users, to
                    execute arbitrary code via a crafted file with a location
                    block (DW_FORM_block) that contains a large number of
                    operations.
-	 CVE-2005-1705 :: gdb before 6.3 searches the current working directory to
                    load the .gdbinit configuration file, which allows local
                    users to execute arbitrary commands as the user running gdb.
-	 CVE-2005-1704 :: Integer overflow in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD)
                    library for gdb before 6.3, binutils, elfutils, and possibly
                    other packages, allows user-assisted attackers to execute
                    arbitrary code via a crafted object file that specifies a
                    large number of section headers, leading to a heap-based
                    buffer overflow.
