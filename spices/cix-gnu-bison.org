=bison= is a general purpose parser generator that converts a grammar
description for an LALR(1) context-free grammar into a C program to parse that
grammar. =bison= can be used to develop a wide range of language parsers, from
ones used in simple desk calculators to complex programming languages. =bison=
is upwardly compatible with =yacc=, so any correctly written =yacc= grammar
should work with =bison= without any changes. If you know =yacc=, you shouldn't
have any trouble using =bison=. You do need to be very proficient in C
programming to be able to use =bison=. =bison= is only needed on systems that
are used for development.
