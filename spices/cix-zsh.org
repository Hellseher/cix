The zsh shell is a command interpreter usable as an interactive login shell and
as a shell script command processor. Zsh resembles the ksh shell (the Korn
shell), but includes many enhancements. Zsh supports command line editing,
built-in spelling correction, programmable command completion, shell functions
(with autoloading), a history mechanism, and more.
