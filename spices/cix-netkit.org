Netkit is a self-contained environment that makes it easy and costless to
emulate complex network configurations on a single host machine. The idea
underlying Netkit is that each network device is implemented by a virtual
machine running the appropriate software. Virtual machines can then be
interconnected as desired by configuring virtual collision domains.
