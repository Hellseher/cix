=at= and =batch= read commands from standard input or from a specified file. At
allows you to specify that a command will be run at a particular time. Batch
will execute commands when the system load levels drop to a particular level.
Both commands use user's shell.

You should install the at package if you need a utility for time-oriented job
control. Note: If it is a recurring job that will need to be repeated at the
same time every day/week, etc. you should use crontab instead.
