Lsyncd watches a local directory trees event monitor interface (inotify or
fsevents). It aggregates and combines events for a few seconds and then spawns
one (or more) process(es) to synchronize the changes. By default this is rsync.
Lsyncd is thus a light-weight live mirror solution that is comparatively easy to
install not requiring new filesystems or block devices and does not hamper local
filesystem performance. Rsync+ssh is an advanced action configuration that uses
a SSH to act file and directory moves directly on the target instead of
re-transmitting the move destination over the wire. Fine-grained customization
can be achieved through the config file. Custom action configs can even be
written from scratch in cascading layers ranging from shell scripts to code
written in the Lua language. This way simple, powerful and flexible
configurations can be acheived. See the manual for details. Lsyncd 2.2.1
requires rsync >= 3.1 on all source and target machines. License: GPLv2 or any
