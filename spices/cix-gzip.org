=gzip= (GNU zip) is a compression utility designed to be a replacement for
=compress=. Its main advantages over compress are much better compression and
freedom from patented algorithms. The GNU Project uses it as the standard
compression program for its system.

** CVE
https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-72/product_id-1670/GNU-Gzip.html
- CVE-2010-0001 :: Integer underflow in the unlzw function in unlzw.c in gzip
                   before 1.4 on 64-bit platforms, as used in ncompress and
                   probably others, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
                   service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
                   code via a crafted archive that uses LZW compression, leading
                   to an array index error.
- CVE-2009-2624 :: The huft_build function in inflate.c in gzip before 1.3.13
                   creates a hufts (aka huffman) table that is too small, which
                   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
                   (application crash or infinite loop) or possibly execute
                   arbitrary code via a crafted archive. NOTE: this issue is
                   caused by a CVE-2006-4334 regression.
- CVE-2005-1228 :: None Directory traversal vulnerability in gunzip -N in gzip
                   1.2.4 through 1.3.5 allows remote attackers to write to
                   arbitrary directories via a .. (dot dot) in the original
                   filename within a compressed file.
- CVE-2005-0988 ::  Race condition in gzip 1.2.4, 1.3.3, and earlier, when
                   decompressing a gzipped file, allows local users to modify
                   permissions of arbitrary files via a hard link attack on a
                   file while it is being decompressed, whose permissions are
                   changed by gzip after the decompression is complete.
- CVE-2005-0758 :: zgrep in gzip before 1.3.5 does not properly sanitize
                   arguments, which allows local users to execute arbitrary
                   commands via filenames that are injected into a sed script.
- CVE-2004-0970 :: None The (1) gzexe, (2) zdiff, and (3) znew scripts in the
                   gzip package, as used by other packages such as ncompress,
                   allows local users to overwrite files via a symlink attack on
                   temporary files. NOTE: the znew vulnerability may overlap
                   CVE-2003-0367.
- CVE-2004-0603 :: gzexe in gzip 1.3.3 and earlier will execute an argument when
                   the creation of a temp file fails instead of exiting the
                   program, which could allow remote attackers or local users to
                   execute arbitrary commands, a different vulnerability than
                   CVE-1999-1332.
- CVE-2001-1228 :: Buffer overflows in gzip 1.3x, 1.2.4, and other versions
                   might allow attackers to execute code via a long file name,
                   possibly remotely if gzip is run on an FTP server.
