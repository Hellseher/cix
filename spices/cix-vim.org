VIM (VIsual editor iMproved) is an updated and improved version of the vi
editor. Vi was the first real screen-based editor for UNIX, and is still very
popular. VIM improves on vi by adding new features: multiple windows,
multi-level undo, block highlighting and more. The vim-enhanced package contains
a version of VIM with extra, recently introduced features like Python and Perl
interpreters.

Install the vim-enhanced package if you'd like to use a version of the VIM
editor which includes recently added enhancements like interpreters for the
Python and Perl scripting languages. You'll also need to install the vim-common
package.
