=facter= is a lightweight program that gathers basic node information about the
hardware and operating system. =facter= is especially useful for retrieving things
like operating system names, hardware characteristics, IP addresses, MAC
addresses, and SSH keys.

=facter= is extensible and allows gathering of node information that may be custom
or site specific. It is easy to extend by including your own custom facts.
=facter= can also be used to create conditional expressions in Puppet that key off
the values returned by facts.
