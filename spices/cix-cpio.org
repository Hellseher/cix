GNU =cpio= copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive. Archives are files
which contain a collection of other files plus information about them, such as
their file name, owner, timestamps, and access permissions. The archive can be
another file on the disk, a magnetic tape, or a pipe. GNU cpio supports the
following archive formats: binary, old ASCII, new ASCII, crc, HPUX binary, HPUX
old ASCII, old tar and POSIX.1 tar. By default, cpio creates binary format
archives, so that they are compatible with older cpio programs. When it is
extracting files from archives, cpio automatically recognizes which kind of
archive it is reading and can read archives created on machines with a different
byte-order.
