** Intro

/Everything is a file/

The  aim of  this repo  is to  collect short  examples of  command usage,  to be
helpful  for *nix  beginners and  interesting  place for  advanced users.   More
detailed information containing here can be reach in man pages.

Man pages common sections.

1. General commands
2. Systems calls
3. C library functions
4. Special files
5. File formats and conventions
6. Games and Screen savers
7. Miscellaneous
8. System administration commands and daemons

*** Basic
For example, you know the command but not sure about package where it goes from

/To check what package command belongs to run/:

on *GNU/Linux*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

    $: CMD="ls"
    $: rpm -qf $(which "$CMD")       # ReadHat, Fedora, CentOS

    $: dpkg-query -S $(which "$CMD") # Debian, Ubuntu, LinuxMint
#+END_EXAMPLE

on *BSD*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $: pkg which $(which "$CMD")
#+END_EXAMPLE

And oposite situation, you want to find out what commands are in the package

/get list of commands/

on *GNU/Linux*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $: PACK="coreutils"
    $: rpm -ql "$PACK" | grep -oP "(?<=\/usr\/bin\/).+" | less
#+END_EXAMPLE

on *GNU/Linux*
