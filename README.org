*** Basic
For example, you know the command but not sure about package where it goes from

/To check what package command belongs to run/:

on *GNU/Linux*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $: CMD="ls"
    $: rpm -qf $(which "$CMD")       # ReadHat, Fedora, CentOS
    $: dpkg-query -S $(which "$CMD") # Debian, Ubuntu, LinuxMint
#+END_EXAMPLE

on *BSD*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $: CMD="ls"
    $: pkg which $(which "$CMD")
#+END_EXAMPLE

And oposite situation, you want to find out what commands are in the package

/get list of commands belong/

on *GNU/Linux*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $: PACK="coreutils"
    $: whatis $(rpm -ql "$PACK" | grep -oP "(?<=in/).+")  # with short description
    $: rpm -ql "$PACK" | grep -P "(?<=in/).+"             # path to command
#+END_EXAMPLE
