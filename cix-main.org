** Basic
For example, you know the command but not sure about package where it goes from

/what package $CMD belongs to/

on *GNU/Linux*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ~$ CMD="ls"
    ~$ rpm -qf $(which "$CMD")       # ReadHad derived
    ~$ dpkg-query -S $(which "$CMD") # Debian derived
#+END_EXAMPLE

on *BSD*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ~$ CMD="ls"
    ~$ pkg which $(which "$CMD")
#+END_EXAMPLE

And oposite situation, you want to find out what commands are in the package

/get list of commands belong to a $PACK/

on *GNU/Linux*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ~$ PACK="coreutils"
    ~$ whatis $(rpm -ql "$PACK" | grep -oP "(?<=in/).+")  # with short description
    ~$ rpm -ql "$PACK" | grep -P "(?<=in/).+"             # path to command
    ~$ dpkg-query -L "$PACK" | grep -oP "(?<=in/).+"      # Debian dirived
#+END_EXAMPLE
